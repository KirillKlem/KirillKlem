<h3 align="center">Computer science student, data scientist 🇷🇺</h3>

I'm currently studying at the university and actively developing in the field of data science
I have read some books to improve my knowledge:
* Grokking Algorithms (Aditya Bhargava)
* Learning Pandas 2.0 (Matthew Rosch)
<br>
I took some courses: <br>
LearnPython (https://learn.python.ru) <br>
Many kaggle courses: Pandas, data visualization, ML and others (https://www.kaggle.com/learn)
<br>
<br>
I do some pet-projects (it will be supplemented in the future)
<table>
  <thead align="center">
    <tr border: none;>
      <td><b>📘 Project</b></td>
    </tr>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><a href="https://github.com/KirillKlem/storage_costs"><b>storage_costs</b></a></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

I try to do tasks on LeetCode (including all new ones about Pandas) <br>
